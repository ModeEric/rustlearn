Long term goal: Try to become a good enough programmer for XAI company for fun(vague on purpose)

Short term goal: Master Rust, proof through following project:

Privacy-Preserving Analytics Library in Rust
The idea is to build a Rust library that:

Implements homomorphic encryption or a simpler encrypted computation method like Paillier or ElGamal encryption.
Supports privacy-preserving analytics operations such as sums, averages, and other basic stats on encrypted data.
Maintains high performance and low latency to make encrypted computations as efficient as possible.
